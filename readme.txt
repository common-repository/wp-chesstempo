== Description ==

> This plugin is essentially unmaintained. If you have it installed and configured, it will probably keep on working for a while.
>
> You might want to take a look at a similar plugin [WP-ShredderChess](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-shredderchess/).
>
> This plugin uses the Yahoo YUI framework and an apparently unmaintained puzzle widget (last update in 2015).
> It pulls in 600 KiB of JavaScript code, which is just a bit too much for such a simple widget.
